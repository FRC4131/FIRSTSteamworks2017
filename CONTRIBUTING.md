# Pre-Submission
Before submitting a pull request, please check the following things.
- Ensure your code fully compiles and has no errors.
- Add a JavaDoc block to your class with:
  - a block describing your test procedure and results (see [Hopper.java](https://github.com/FRC4131/FIRSTSteamworks2017/blob/7766d29539e85c92bd9ff6086858e5a1d9a0132d/src/org/usfirst/frc/team4131/robot/subsystems/Hopper.java#L9-L17))
  - an `@author` tag, with your name
  - an `@since` tag, with the date you submit the pull request
- Ensure field, parameter, and variable names are in camelCase and constants are in CONSTANT_CASE.
- Ensure you are up-to-date with the master repository. If not, create a pull request on your fork to merge in the new changes.

# Submission
You're already here! Set `FRC4131/FIRSTSteamworks2017` as the base, and your fork as the head. If you don't see these options, click "Compare across forks."  
After you click "Create pull request", @endreman0 and @reederc42 will be notified. One of them will check over your code for the pre-submission requirements, and if it passes, arrange with you to test it. If you pass the test, great! They'll merge your changes, and you can move on to a new item.  
If you do not meet the pre-submission requirements or the tests fail, the pull request will be closed and you'll get some feedback here and in person about what to fix. Once you've implemented the suggested changes, re-open the pull request and the process will be repeated.

# Post-Submission
Once your pull request is merged, it becomes part of this repository. Now, other members of the team will be responsible for merging your changes into their fork before they can submit changes.
