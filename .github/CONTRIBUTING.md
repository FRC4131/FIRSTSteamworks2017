# Are you sure you want to do that?
Only open a pull request when you are completely done with what you're working on. This way, the main repository always has working code.

# What now?
1. Title the pull request appropriately, with the name of what you've worked on.
1. Make sure the base is FRC4131/FIRSTSteamwoks2017, and the head is your fork.
1. Request a review (in the top-right corner) from Ian (@endreman0), Chris (@reederc42), or Michael (no GitHub account yet).
1. We'll help you test your code, and make sure everything works as intended.
1. If your work checks out, great! We'll merge it, and you can move to another project.
1. If changes need to be made, you can commit them to your fork and they'll automatically be added to the pull request.
